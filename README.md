    simple_shell - A basic shell program

# INTRODUCTION
    This repository is a Holberton School project. The assignment involved creating a simple shell,
    similar to the Bourne Shell (sh) by Stephen Bourne, using C and a restricted set of standard library
    functions.

# SYNOPSIS
    simple_shell

# DESCRIPTION
    simple_shell is a minimalistic shell program that allows users to enter commands
    and executes them. It provides a simple command-line interface, reads user input,
    and executes commands entered by the user. The shell supports basic command execution,
    including the ability to exit the shell.

    The shell prompts the user with "$ " when running interactively. It reads user input,
    trims leading and trailing whitespace, and then tokenizes and executes the entered command
    using the Tok function. The shell continues to run until the user enters the "exit" command.

    Additionally, the shell provides the following functionalities:
    - Displaying the environment variables using the "env" command.
    - Stat command to check the existence of files.
