NAME
    simple_shell - A basic shell program

SYNOPSIS
    simple_shell

DESCRIPTION
    simple_shell is a minimalistic shell program that allows users to enter commands
    and executes them. It provides a simple command-line interface, reads user input,
    and executes commands entered by the user. The shell supports basic command execution,
    including the ability to exit the shell.

    The shell prompts the user with "$ " when running interactively. It reads user input,
    trims leading and trailing whitespace, and then tokenizes and executes the entered command
    using the Tok function. The shell continues to run until the user enters the "exit" command.

    Additionally, the shell provides the following functionalities:
    - Displaying the environment variables using the "env" command.
    - Stat command to check the existence of files.

EXAMPLES
    To run the simple shell, compile the source code and execute the resulting binary:

    $ gcc -o simple_shell simple_shell.c
    $ ./simple_shell

    The shell will display a prompt:
    $ 

    Enter commands after the prompt and press Enter to execute them:
    $ ls
    file1.txt file2.txt
    $ pwd
    /home/user
    $ echo "Hello, World!"
    Hello, World!

    To exit the shell, enter the "exit" command:
    $ exit

    Additional commands:
    $ env       # Display environment variables
    $ stat file # Check the existence of a file
