SYNOPSIS
    simple_shell

DESCRIPTION
    simple_shell is a minimalistic shell program that allows users to enter commands and executes
    them. It provides a simple command-line interface, reads user input, and executes commands
    entered by the user. The shell supports basic command execution, including the ability
    to exit the shell.

    The shell prompts the user with "$ " when running interactively. It reads user input, trims leading
    and trailing whitespace, and then tokenizes and executes the entered command using the Tok function.
    The shell continues to run until the user enters the "exit" command.
